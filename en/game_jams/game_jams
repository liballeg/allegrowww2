[The Allegro SizeHack3D 2001](http://gamecode.tripod.com/sizehack3d.html)

[The Allegro Team Competition 2001](http://www.student.wau.nl/~martijni/teamcompo/)
- The purpose of the competition is not
only to match the game programming skills of different people, but also to
promote programming in teams, to improve the organisation skills involved.
To make it even more interesting, the rules say that the team must consist
of people from different countries.

[The Pixelate Games Competition 2001](http://binarysurge.netfirms.com/pgc/)
- This time you will have a few months to
write your entry, but will it be good enough?

[IdeaHack 2001](http://www.hot.ee/ideahack/)
- Never found the appropriate competition due to restrictive
rules? This one is for you: before entering, you submit an idea or
requirement your game will have to follow, and your entry will be scored
depending on how well you meet your own goal.

[BlitzHack 2003](http://www.binarysurge.com/blitzhack/)
- The BlitzHack is a six-hour-long Allegro-focussed game
programming competition, in which entrants strive to make the best game
possible with extremely limited time constraints using a shared backstory
as a theme and basis for the game, a shared media set, and a shared code
snippet set.
