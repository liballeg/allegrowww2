# Language bindings

Although Allegro is written in C and C++, and is mainly designed to be used
from such, it's possible to use Allegro from other programming languages.

# Bindings for Allegro 5

[allua]
:   Lua binding to Allegro 5 by Trezker.

Python
:   The Allegro 5 distribution comes with a basic Python wrapper;
    see the `python` directory.


# Bindings for Allegro 4

## Ada

[AdaAllegro]
:   Leonid Dulman has worked on providing an ADA-95(2005) interface
    for the Allegro game library.

## C++

[alBitmap]
:   alBitmap is a C++ Wrapper for the Allegro BITMAP datatype.
    Features built-in memory allocation/deallocation, inlined functions for
    bitmap creation, loading, saving, blitting, comparing, plus some
    convenience functions for printing text with STL's string type.

[Allegro Simplificator]
:   Allegro Simplificator is a C++ wrapper. It provides
    classes for most Allegro functions and adds some new functionality
    (cross-platform networking). It comes with some examples and extensive
    documentation. 

## C#

[AllegNet]
:   AllegNet is a .NET library, coded in [C# 2.0][wikipedia_C#] based on
    Allegro 4.2.0. With AllegNet you can build your own video game in full
    managed code. So you can use this to build C#, vb.net, J# and C++ managed
    games.

[Mallegro]
:   Mallegro (or Managed Allegro) is a .NET wrapper for Allegro written
    by Michael Jensen. It promises making Allegro available to C# and VB.NET
    developers.

## D

[DAllegro]
:   Tydr Schnubbis organised an effort to be able to use Allegro from
    the D programming language.

## Lisp

[Common Lisp FFI for Allegro](http://cl-alleg.sourceforge.net/)
:   cl-alleg provides a foreign function interface for the Allegro games
    library. This is built on top of
    [CFFI](http://cl-alleg.sourceforge.net/)
    and so should be portable across
    multiple common lisp implementations. The author also writes a cl-alleg
    game development blog at <http://gameylisp.blogspot.com/>.

## Lua

[LuAllegro]
:   The goal of the LuAllegro project is to provide a free multi-platform
    graphics library for [Lua]. Of course, Allegro is used for this purpose.

## Mercury

[Mercury]
:   Mercury-Allegro provides a fairly complete set of bindings to
    Allegro and AllegroGL for the Mercury programming language. It's available as
    part of the mercury-extras ROTD (release-of-the-day) distributions on the
    Mercury web site. 

## Pascal

[Allegro.pas]
:   Allegro.pas is a wrapper to use Allegro with Pascal compilers
    like [Delphi] or [Free Pascal].

## Perl

[AlPerl]
:   A [Perl] interface to Allegro written by Colin O'Leary.

## Python

[PyAllegro]
:   This page hosts all available [Python] bindings. There are
    currently two projects: Alpy (a pure C interface) and PyAlleg (a Pyrex
    interface).

## Scheme

[MzScheme][allegro-mzscheme]
:   Allegro scheme is a set of MzScheme bindings to Allegro written by
    Jon Rafkind. Using MzScheme's nice FFI library it is very easy to bind
    scheme to any C library. There is a set of bindings directly to Allegro in
    allegro.ss and a scheme wrapper which should make it easier to use in
    image.ss.

[Wiki page about bindings][awiki_bindings]
:   The Wiki also has a page about language bindings.
    Because everyone can edit it, it may have additional links not listed here.
    But they may not work or point to abandoned or very work in progress work.
