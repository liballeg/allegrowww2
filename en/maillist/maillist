\[AGP] Allegro Game Programming
-------------------------------

Between September 1998 and January 2003 existed the Allegro Game Programming
mailing list. This list was used by people to ask about generic game
programming problems not so closely related to Allegro. The mailing list
dropped in popularity and was not moved to SourceForge,
leaving the main Allegro mailing for both Allegro and generic programming
problems.

when it was too noisy to do so on [AD].
