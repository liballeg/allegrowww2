# Allegro on IRC

If you want to get help quickly, or simply discuss programming with Allegro
with other people, join us in the **#allegro** channel on the Libera IRC network
<https://libera.chat/>. You will find many of the allegro.cc regulars and
some of the developers there. Discussion will be related to Allegro as often
as it will be not.

## Notes about using IRC

If you don't know how to enter the channel, you can obtain a list of servers
from <https://libera.chat/>. If you are new to IRC, it is also
a good idea to read <https://libera.chat/guidelines> so you can
learn quickly what are the things you shouldn't do on the channel to avoid
upsetting people. If you have problems using the Allegro library, there is a
lot of documentation you should check before coming here. You can for example
check the **Documentation** section of this web page, where you have the FAQ, help
guidelines and Allegro's documentation online.

The language used in the IRC channel is **English**. You can eventually ask
there in another language, but most of the people there understand only
English, so this would limit the richness of your conversation ;).
